OldDays, NBXlite and SpawnHuman return numerous things from the old days of Minecraft Java Edition back into the game
NBXlite is a fork of InsanityBringer's NoBiomesX
(Also known as the Nostalgia Project, feel free to check out the original post here: https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1275124-1-0-0-no-biomes-x-very-dead-use-exalms-stuff)

SSPC is a fork of simo_415's Single Player Commands 3.2.2.
Everything in src/client/spc, bin/spc-* and bin-old/spc-* is licenced under GNU LGPLv3.

I'm just a random infividual who wanted to archive these mods so they wouldn't be lost.
